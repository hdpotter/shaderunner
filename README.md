# Shaderunner
This library is a learning exercise and a component in several personal projects.  Expect regular breaking changes; we do not recommend using Shaderunner in your projects in its current state.

Shaderunner is a basic graphics layer over WGPU, winit, adapted and expanded from Benjamin Hansen's excellent [WGPU tutorial](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/).  It supports basic mesh construction and rendering with colored vertices; it does not yet support textures.
